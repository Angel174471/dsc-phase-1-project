# Phase 1 Project

## Project Overview

For this project, I used exploratory data analysis using different data analysis packages in python to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. I was charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. I had to then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

I used the data from:

* title.basics.csv
* title.ratings.csv
* tmdb.movies.csv
* tn.movie_budget.csv

### Deliverables

This GitHub repository contains all the deliverables for this project:

* A **GitHub repository**
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **non-technical presentation**

### Outline

1. *Exploratory Data Analysis:* I will conduct a thorough exploration of the movie data using pandas data frames and different data visualization techniques in python, analyzing various factors such as genre, budget, release date, and audience ratings. This analysis will help us understand which types of films are currently performing the best.

2. *Identify Successful Film Types:* Based on my analysis, I will identify the genres and release periods that have shown the highest performance. This will enable me to pinpoint the types of films that resonate well with the audience and generate significant profit.

3. *Actionable Recommendations:* I will translate my findings into concrete business recommendations for the head of Microsoft's new movie studio. These recommendations will guide them in making informed decisions about the types of films to create. My suggestions may include:

   - Investing in genres that have consistently performed well, such as action or adventure.
   - Making the worldwide market their most targeted audience.
   - Timing film releases strategically, considering factors like seasonal trends, competition, and audience preferences.

4. *Effective Communication:* To ensure clear communication, I will create a cohesive storyline that the head of Microsoft's movie studio can easily follow. I'll present the steps of my analysis, highlighting the most important points and omitting unnecessary technical details. The code in the Notebook is very easy to follow and runs from top to bottom, step by step. Visualizations will play a crucial role in conveying my findings. I will use simple, well-formatted visuals such as bar charts and line graphs that directly support my recommendations.


## Summary

By adopting the strategies in the Notebook and leveraging the identified insights, the new movie studio can position itself for success in the competitive movie industry and increase the chances of producing profitable and well-received movies.
